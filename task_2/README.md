Practical results:
Analitical calculation result: 2.6666666666666665
Area under the curve using Monte Carlo method: 2.7136

In this implementation, the function monte_carlo_simulation is designed to estimate the area under the curve of the function f(x) = x^2 over the interval [a, b]. The number of experiments (num_experiments) represents the quantity of randomly generated points.

The accuracy of the Monte Carlo simulation is influenced by the number of experiments performed. Increasing the number of experiments generally improves the precision of the result, but it comes at the cost of increased computational resources.

Observations:
The analytical method provides a precise solution by integrating the function.
The Monte Carlo method, being a stochastic approach, provides an estimate that may vary based on the random sampling. The accuracy is expected to improve as the number of experiments increases.

Conclusion:
The comparison allows us to draw conclusions about the effectiveness and limitations of both methods in this particular context.
